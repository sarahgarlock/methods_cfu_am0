# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
This honestly was not easy for me. I had to use a ton of different resources to fully understand it. I think I might be overthinking it, it's probably not a hard as I'm making it out to be. I am proud that I got through the assignment, though I'm not 100% sure that I understood everything. It was brought up that we are going to be using Methods a lot so I'm sure I'll get the hang of it eventually.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods seem to make writing code easier. Reusability was a word that came up a few times. We haven't written any long amounts of code but I would imagine that once we get going, we will be thankful to have a handy tool such as Methods.
